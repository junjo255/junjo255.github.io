    "I love this stuff!!! It is a quality product. At first, I thought it was ‚Äústicky/tacky‚Äù but when it completely dried, my skin was soooo soft. I almost don‚Äôt want to do this perfect review because I want it to be my little secret ü§´",
    "I bought this as an addition to my diy hand sanitizer. This is perfect! It gives it just a thick enough feel that it's not runny and it doesnt dry my hands out.",
    "I am finding the reviews of this product to be spot on! It is a little sticky when it starts to dry, but dries beautifully and so happy with the feeling I'm left with. ",
    "I bought this just as a moisturizer, but it has surpassed my expectations! My face has never looked clearer than it does now; especially during these stressing times when I'm more prone to breakouts!",
    "I really like this lotion. I use it as an after shave and it works great. I see complaints about the smell, but I think it‚Äôs fine. Doesn‚Äôt smell bad to me. The benefits it provides are much more important.",
    "Cellskin clean pine gel is really very good so handy to use thank you just love them",
    "Great sanitiser, really useful for popping in my handbag and keeping some in the car!",

    "Korean KF94 Certified Mask with the quality we already are used to of Korean Products.",
    "it‚Äôs good quality bought 4 the only thing it‚Äôs not wide enough if you have a long face it won‚Äôt really fit since it bearly covers me and I don‚Äôt really have a long face but besides that it‚Äôs good I would just put a thin mask over it for just a little bit more tightness but I would recommend best one yet",
    "Exactly as described. While looking up more information about K94 masks, I learned this will block most contaminants small as 4 microns. N95 block as small as 3 microns. Viruses are around 1 micron and usually transmitted via 3-5 microns or larger particles so in most cases this will protect you if you need to venture outside.",
    "This mask fits like a surgical mask but it is rated as KF94, which means it lets in particles 1 nm bigger than the N95 mask. I really like this mask, especially the black color. I'm gonna buy a case to keep it in.",
